The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.

Expanding inputs for image tokens in LLaVa-NeXT should be done in processing. Please add `patch_size` and `vision_feature_select_strategy` to the model's processing config or set directly with `processor.patch_size = {{patch_size}}` and processor.vision_feature_select_strategy = {{vision_feature_select_strategy}}`. Using processors without these attributes in the config is deprecated and will throw an error in v4.47.
Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Ground Truth: A white bishop with a white knight.
Model Output: The image shows a chess set with the following pieces:

- A white king, which is the central piece in the center of the image.
- A white queen, which is the second piece from the king, located to the right of the king.
- A white rook, which is the third piece from the king, located to the right of the queen.
- A white bishop, which is the fourth piece from the king, located to the right of the rook.
- A white knight, which is the fifth piece from the king, located to the right of the bishop.
- A white pawn, which is the sixth piece from the king, located to the right of the knight.

The pieces are made of a light-colored material, possibly plastic or a similar synthetic material, and they appear to be a simple, possibly educational or novelty set, given their simplistic design and the absence of intricate details or engravings. The pieces are placed on a flat, light-colored surface, which could be a table or a similar flat, horizontal object.
Batch BLEU: 0.0000, Batch BERTScore F1: 0.8155
Ground Truth: A black rook, a black bishop and a white bishop all standing together.
Model Output: The image shows a set of chess pieces laid out on a flat surface. From left to right, there is a **black Rook**, a **black Knight**, a **white Rook**, a **white Knight**, and a **white Bishop**. The pieces are in a somewhat disorganized arrangement, with the Rooks at the ends and the Knights and Bishop in the middle. The pieces appear to be of a standard design, with the Rooks being the tallest and the Bishop being the shortest.
Batch BLEU: 0.0000, Batch BERTScore F1: 0.8461
Ground Truth: A black knight and a white rook. There is also half of what appears to be a black pawn to the side.
Model Output: The image shows a chess set with the following pieces:

- A white king, which is the central piece in the image.
- A black rook, which is the piece to the left of the king.
- A white bishop, which is the piece to the right of the king.
- A black knight, which is the piece to the right of the rook.
- A white pawn, which is the piece to the left of the rook.

The pieces are placed on a flat, light-colored surface, and the lighting suggests an indoor setting. The pieces appear to be of a standard chess set, with the king being the most prominent due to its central position.

Ground Truth: A white bishop with a white knight.
Model Output: The image shows two chess pieces on a wooden surface. On the left, there is a white rook with a black square base, and on the right, there is a black rook with a white square base. Both pieces appear to be made of a light-colored material, possibly plastic or wood, and have a smooth finish. The rooks are positioned diagonally from each other, with the white rook on the left and the black rook on the right.

The pieces appear to be made of a dark wood, possibly ebony, for the black pieces and a lighter wood, possibly light-colored wood or plastic, for the white pieces. The image is taken from a perspective that casts a shadow on the surface, indicating a light source from the upper left side.

Ground Truth: A black knight and a white rook. There is also half of what appears to be a black pawn to the side.
Model Output: The image shows a chessboard with two pieces on it. On the left, there is a black rook, which is a piece that can move horizontally or vertically. On the right, there is a white queen, which is the most powerful piece in the game of chess, able to move in any direction along a rank, file, or diagonal. The chessboard itself is not fully visible, but it appears to be a standard wooden chessboard with alternating light and dark squares.

Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Ground Truth: A white bishop with a white knight.
Model Output: The image shows a wooden chess set with the following pieces visible:

- A white king.
- A white queen.
- A white knight.
- A black pawn.
- A black rook.

The pieces are arranged on a wooden surface, and the focus is on the king and the queen, which are standing close together. The other pieces are partially visible in the background.
